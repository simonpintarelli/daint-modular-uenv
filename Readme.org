* Modular UENV example recipe

Base uenvs:
- [[file:recipe-gcc][recipe-gcc]] gcc13 built with system gcc12
  - gcc13 installed (via spack/stackinator) in =/user-environment/gcc/13.3.0=
- [[file:recipe-cuda][recipe-cuda]]
  - cuda12.8 installed (via spack/stackinator) in =/user-environment/cuda/12.8.0=
- [[file:recipe-nvhpc][recipe-nvhpc]] (depends on the gcc base uenv)

The final uenv is [[file:recipe-osu-micro-gcc][recipe-osu-micro-gcc]] it uses the cuda/gcc base uenvs.

- Basic support for modular uenvs in ~uenv2~ (currently from json description only):  https://github.com/eth-cscs/uenv2/tree/modular-sqfs
- ~alps-cluster-config~ used to build the images with ~spack@develop~: https://github.com/eth-cscs/alps-cluster-config/tree/feat/modular-uenv
- Stackinator: https://github.com/eth-cscs/stackinator/pull/224
